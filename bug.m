This bug occurs when using KVO (Key-Value Observing) in Objective-C.  The observer is not removed properly, leading to crashes or unexpected behavior after the observed object is deallocated.  This is often due to forgetting to remove the observer in `-dealloc` or during other cleanup operations.

```objectivec
// Incorrect - observer not removed
[someObject addObserver:self forKeyPath:@"someKeyPath" options:NSKeyValueObservingOptionNew context:NULL];

// ... later ...
// someObject is deallocated without observer removal
```
